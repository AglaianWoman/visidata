# Concepts of VisiData

- Commands and Command History
   - basic movement
   - the 'g' prefix
   - in general, shift-letter pushes a sheet, ctrl-letter performs some state-modifying action, g-something supersizes it
       - but ghjkl are special (shift and ctrl do something else)
   - shift-number-row ~!@#$% sets type of column (note different on 'C'olumns sheet)
   - commands are generally mnemonic in some way
- Options and saving user settings
- Left and Right Status Lines
   - Left Status History
   - Input Line/History

- editing cells

## Sheets, Rows, and Columns, and the Cursor

- 'S'heet stack (sheets sheet)

- 'C'olumns sheet
   - Column Types: int/float/str/date/anytype
   - Key Columns
   - selecting/sorting/searching rows
   - movement through sheets (TAB, BTAB, ^^, `)
   - copying sheets, the sheet stack, diving into sources, another 'S' for the full list of sheets


- Metasheets
   - 'T'asks sheet
   - 'E'rrors sheet
   - 'I'nclude Filters sheet
   - 'X' last inputs sheet
   - 'V'iew current cell

- Builtin Analysis
   - 'F'requency Analysis, histogram, aggregated columns

- Asynchronous Tasks
   ^C

## programmer's guide
   - making a new sheet loader
   - using sheet properties
      - cursorRow
      - cursorCol
   - ^Quit, ^Debug

### the real goal is efficient workflow for text mode junkies
   - if the core is solid, it can easily be transformed into:
      - directory/file browser (like commander)
      - rdbms browser with editing capability
      - python debugging aid (can inspect and dive into python objects)
      - git (or other vcs) interface
      - wrappers for top and many other unix utilities that have columnar output
      - fun spreadsheet games
      - and anything else that presents discrete columnar data!
