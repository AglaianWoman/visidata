# cleanups
- make options consistent
- documentation
   - emphasize diff from spreadsheet; closer to Pandas/RDBMS
   - "keyboard" commands
   - in example: "copy" is jarring
   - provide another example for a command
   - Python 'module' -> 'package'
   - creating new sheet grammar
   - add status() on write to journal example
   - move from wiki to readthedocs
- autodetect colexpr types
- TextwrapViewer based on unicode width (as with clipdraw)
- make all generated column names be valid identifiers
- `mean` aggregator should be float
- option for case-sensitive regex
- .tsv should deal with tabs/newlines properly on ^S[ave]
- 'new sheet'
- add hook: extend sheet with new row
- make alternate help command for OSes which don't send F1 to the terminal by default
- editCell() moves down automatically; this can be a weird bug when used programmatically
- Fix Textwrap error on .db file
- document dev environment setup (export? virtualenv?)

# features
- regex workflow for replace/delete
- undo/replay/save to .vd
- unclean data notices
- freeze column(s)
- load larger-than-memory .tsv files
- make sqlite db editable

## requiring design
- copy this column to different sheet
- apply this layout to different sheet
- make 'q' less destructive (query on exit?)
- jump to next selected row
- select rows with invalid values

# applications
- working vdzulip client
  - start new topic
  - reply to existing topic
- other sql databases (probably separate impls instead of framework like blaze)
- sweet interface to git
- asteroid mining nanobots (spreadsheet game)
- shell commands (autoparse into columns)

# non-code
- video demos
- full API reference (can write visidata plugins/sources/apps without looking at core vd code)

# release process
- first to beta.pypi

# documentation headings
- Movement basics
- q/ESC/Help
- search/filter
- save
- column manipulation
- statistical analysis
- sheet manipulation
  - working w/ multiple sheets (joins)
