# cleanups
- make options consistent
- documentation
   - emphasize diff from spreadsheet; closer to Pandas/RDBMS
   - "keyboard" commands
   - in example: "copy" is jarring
   - provide another example for a command
   - Python 'module' -> 'package'
   - creating new sheet grammar
   - add status() on write to journal example
   - move from wiki to readthedocs
- autodetect colexpr types
- TextwrapViewer based on unicode width (as with clipdraw)
- make all generated column names be valid identifiers
- `mean` aggregator should be float
- option for case-sensitive regex
- .tsv should deal with tabs/newlines properly on ^S[ave]
- 'new sheet'
- add hook: extend sheet with new row (key command)
- make alternate help command for OSes which don't send F1 to the terminal by default (maybe 'z?' or ALT-H--make <ESC> be a special pseudo-prefix?)
- editCell() moves down automatically; this can be a weird bug when used programmatically
- Fix Textwrap error on .db file
- document dev environment setup (export? virtualenv?)

## Bugs
- hide column, edit value in column after it, note that default value is from earlier column, and edited value stored in wrong place!
- gd with cursor on the only selected row, does not delete row
- rows with CalcErrorStr should sort
- fix 'gn/gp' to not error 'no columns'
- date_time in .zip should be @ date type
bug: column order on Columns sheet does NOT affect column order on real sheet.


# features
- add implicit/hidden row number, to make all rows unique and to be able to sort by 'original' ordering
- regex workflow for replace/delete
- undo/replay/save to .vd
   - editlog always starts replaying with no selected rows
   - 'a' on editlog sheet applies one row at a time to sheets[1]?
- unclean data notices
- freeze column(s)
- load larger-than-memory .tsv files
- make sqlite db editable
- set window title to current sheet?  append progress % ?
- select rows via python expr
- ability to select rows based on literal value (including type; not just simple string regex)
- load filter (relatively easy support for larger-than-memory data sources)
- select to beginning/end of rows
- concatenate sheets: append by rows
- 'describe' sheet provides stats for each column; values are cached until reload
- editline: Tab/S-Tab completion
   - more generic actions to "copy from sheet" and "paste into input line".
- non-string columns should be freq analyzed into continuous bins
- action to make a new sheet with unique keys as the new columns
- notice of key column on column screen
- replace current column with multiple from regex groups!
- delete regex groups entirely
- melt, unmelt 
- call 'file' on current file, show on status
- auto-sort ([key] columns in order)
- determine columns by max(len(r) for r in rows)


## requiring design
- copy this column to different sheet
- apply this layout to different sheet
- make 'q' less destructive (query on exit?)
   - pause before reloading over edited file
- jump to next selected row
- select rows with invalid values
- collapse rows by column; other columns are aggregated.  collapse is a toggle.
- save option preferences to be autoloaded next time
- .py not auto-executed?
- able to scroll left/right on super-wide-column (wider than screen) textviewer
- 'P'inned sheets added with '.' and all saved with g^S, and asked on exit if modified

## user interface
- some key to map next key to jump to this sheet.  e.g. Y F8 sets F8 to come back here
- make A/B/C default names usable from the get go (make column.name), but don't save them
- convert money strings to floats, stripping currency token.  create currency type?
- vd *.json -> sheet listing files?
- reserve backspace for undo (delete last row of editlog and replay)


# applications
- working vdzulip client
  - start new topic
  - reply to existing topic
- other sql databases (probably separate impls instead of framework like blaze)
- sweet interface to git
- asteroid mining nanobots (spreadsheet game)
- shell commands (autoparse into columns)
   - exec process (like `top`), split output, autoreload
   - allow TextSheet contents as source
- pcap parser
- binary file parser (neat interface for e.g. reverse engineering protocols)

## plugins
- codebook as you go (document all sheets/columns)
  - add helpstr field to columns?
- open_/save_hdf5
- loader for OData (odata.org) interface with ODataPy
- .csvs: multiple .csv files in one, separated by extra newlines
- other .json tabular formats

# non-code
- video demos
   - every step of demo, actions should report status
- full API reference (can write visidata plugins/sources/apps without looking at core vd code)

# release process
- first to beta.pypi

# documentation headings
- Movement basics
- q/ESC/Help
- search/filter
- save
- column manipulation
- statistical analysis
- sheet manipulation
  - working w/ multiple sheets (joins)
- new toplevel concept names
  - reload: clear sheet and load from raw source into .rows
  - apply [editlog]: appky a description of changes to the data: adding a column, filter by rows, sorting by column
  - replay: reload and apply editlog
