# Release checklist

1. Add version and release date to CHANGELOG with bullet points of major changes.

2. Bump version at top of README.md, in __version__ in visidata/vd.py, and in setup.py.

3. Merge to master and create a tag 'v#.##' for that commit.

4. Push to testpypi and then pypi.

        python setup.py sdist upload -r testpypi
