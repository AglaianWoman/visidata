# Loading data

## How to specify a source

In VisiData, [loaders](/docs/loaders) load files of a particular type. [These sources are currently supported](/man#loaders).

On default, the file extension determines which loader is used. Unknown filetypes are loaded as **Text sheets**.

~~~
vd sample.tsv
ps aux | vd
~~~

To force a particular loader, pass `-f` with the filetype or format name.

~~~
vd -f sqlite bar.db
ls -l | vd -f fixed
~~~

## How to load multiple datasets simultaneously

Multiple files can be passed as inputs through the commandline.

~~~
vd birdsdiet.tsv surveys.csv sunshinelist.html
~~~

Upon launching, the last dataset to load (in this case, sunshinelist.html) will be displayed on top.

To load another file, press `o` and enter a filepath.

## How to access other loaded or derived sheets:

1. Press `S` to open the **Sheets sheet**.
2. Move the cursor to the row containing the desired sheet.
3. Press `Enter` to jump to the sheet referenced in that current cursor row.
