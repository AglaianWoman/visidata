# Asciicast plan
- act out a simple workflow (maybe describe or pivot)
- save the cmdlog with '^D'
- quit session (gq)
- then bin/vd -p cmdlog.vd

# Ponderings
We are not going to overcomplicate with `-w` or pausing and playing because the point of this is to show how to restore a session.
Another howto for 'replaying' perhaps? Or that complexity will go into a docs/cmdlog
