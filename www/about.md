## What is VisiData?

VisiData is an open source multitool for data exploration and manipulation.
It combines the clarity of a spreadsheet, the efficiency of the terminal, and the power of Python, into a lightweight utility which can handle millions of rows with ease.

## Who wrote it?

My name is [Saul Pwanson](http://saul.pw) and I've worked as a software developer for over 20 years.
I live in Seattle but the terminal is my home.

## What inspired VisiData?

As a data worker, I frequently want to take a quick peek at some raw data, to check something out, or to get a feel for what's there.

I usually managed to get what I needed with a combination of UNIX utilities and ad-hoc Python scripts.
But it was a real slog sometimes, and my wrists were starting to hurt.

So I found myself thinking back to a tool I made back in 2011, a pseudo-spreadsheet terminal program for configuring and monitoring F5 routers.

The design, both interface and architecture, worked unreasonably well.
It provided lot of functionality, with a minimum footprint, and it could be easily extended.
Even at the time, I felt it had more potential, but I had to set it aside to work on other things.

So at the end of 2016, I decided to take a personal sabbatical and use my experience with data to write another version of this tool.
One that could be used in any terminal, with any data source, with minimal requirements and zero configuration.
